"""Static mesh-network model imported from a ThingOS ``.connect`` export.

The btmesh stack rides on a mesh network provisioned by another app (the
Häfele Connect Mesh / ThingOS app). That app exports the network — NetKey,
AppKey, and every node's composition (unicast, elements, models) — as a
``.connect`` JSON file. This module parses that file into an immutable model
so the runtime knows which key to use and which element/unicast to address.

The model here is deliberately DISTINCT from :mod:`btmesh.node`:

* :class:`btmesh.node.MeshNode` is the *runtime* — it sends/receives access
  messages over a subnet.
* The classes here (:class:`Network`, :class:`Node`, :class:`Element`,
  :class:`Model`) are *static descriptors* parsed from the ``.connect`` file.
  They are named without the ``Mesh`` prefix precisely to avoid colliding with
  the runtime ``MeshNode`` when both are imported together.

Composition maps onto the SIG Mesh Profile §4.2 model hierarchy: a node owns
one or more elements (each with a unicast address = node base + element index,
§3.4.2), and each element hosts SIG or vendor models (§4.2.1) with a set of
bound application-key indexes.
