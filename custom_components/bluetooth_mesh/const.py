# Options-flow key: how long (seconds) to keep the proxy connection open after
# the last command before dropping it to free the lamp's single proxy slot.
# 0 = keep it always open (most responsive; the Häfele app then cannot connect
# to the lamp while the integration is loaded). A positive value trades a
# multi-second cold-start after that idle period for letting the vendor app
# reclaim the lamp when Home Assistant is not actively driving it.

# Options-flow key: hold a link to EVERY reachable proxy node, not just one.
# For a mesh whose nodes cannot hear each other (two boxes either side of a
# divider, seen 2026-10-03): through one link only that node's island answers,
# and the vendor app shows the same. Off by default because each link takes a
# node's single proxy slot -- with all of them held, the vendor app has no node
# left to connect to.

# Options-flow key: the unicast address the integration transmits FROM.
# 0 means "derive it" — the top of the unicast range, stepping down past any
# address the imported network already uses.
#
# It is overridable because the one thing an export cannot tell us is which
# address the vendor app gave ITSELF: exports carry no provisioner node. If that
# address happens to be ours, every message we send is discarded as a replay by
# nodes that hold a sequence number for it, before any model sees it — with
# nothing in any log to say so. Moving off it is the only way to find out.

# Options-flow key: the unicast addresses whose Light CTL server maps colour
# temperature INVERSELY — asking for warm produces cool. The requested Kelvin is
# mirrored around the exposed range before being sent to those, and to those
# only: mirroring a spec-conformant lamp inverts warm and cool end to end.
#
# Per lamp, not per vendor. It was gated on the company identifier until 0.5.1,
# when issue #7 produced a Häfele lamp the mirror was itself inverting — so the
# quirk varies WITHIN a vendor, by model or firmware, and a CID cannot predict
# it. Stored as a list of addresses rather than a dict of booleans because
# options are serialised to JSON, which has no integer keys: a dict comes back
# keyed by strings after a restart and every lookup silently misses.
#
# Absent and empty mean different things. Absent is an entry that predates the
# option, and the first setup seeds it from the old vendor rule so no working
# install flips on upgrade; empty is a user who unchecked every lamp, and must
# be left alone.
