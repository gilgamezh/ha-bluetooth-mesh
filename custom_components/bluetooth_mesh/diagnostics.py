"""Diagnostics for the Bluetooth Mesh integration.

Support for this integration is almost always the same question: *which proxy
does Home Assistant see, and does it belong to my network?* This dump answers
it without a log-level round trip — the Network ID we look for, every 0x1828
advert currently visible, the IV Index and SEQ cursor in use, and each node's
composition (which decides what an entity can do).

**Nothing here may carry key material.** The config entry stores a whole
``.connect`` export verbatim — NetKey, AppKey and every node's DeviceKey — and
a diagnostics dump is meant to be pasted into a public issue. The entry data is
therefore never echoed; only derived, non-secret values are.

    Two requests, because they answer different questions and only one of them
    is trustworthy when it fails:

    * **Config Relay Get** — four bytes of answer, unsegmented in both
      directions. This is ``answered``, and it is the honest reachability
      signal: our message reached the node's Config Server and its reply came
      back. It needs no AppKey binding, no Light LC mode and no vendor model, so
      it separates "never arrived" from "arrived and was ignored". Its content
      matters too: a node that does not relay forwards nothing from our proxy
      connection into the rest of the mesh.
    * **Composition Data Get** — what the node says it *is*, against which the
      export (the vendor app's account of it) can be checked. Its Status is
      segmented. That used to make a null here meaningless, because the stack
      transmitted no Segment Acks and the reply could never complete (#9);
      since 0.4.6 it acknowledges them, so on a node that *answered* the relay
      request a null composition is now a finding in its own right rather than
      an artefact of our own transport.

    Skipped entirely when no proxy connection is held: a diagnostics download
    should not spend the connect timeout dialling a proxy that is not there.
