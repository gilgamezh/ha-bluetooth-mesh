"""Runtime coordinator for the Bluetooth Mesh integration (Task B3).

This is the single long-lived object per config entry. It owns the parsed
:class:`btmesh.network_model.Network`, and drives mesh commands through the
HA-bluetooth bridge (:mod:`.mesh_transport`) over one **held** proxy
connection, serialised by a single lock.

A mesh node offers a *single* proxy connection slot, shared with the vendor
app, so how long the link is held is the user's choice (the keep-alive option).
``0``, the default, keeps it for good and re-establishes it when it drops: every
command is then instant. A positive value hands the slot back after that many
idle seconds, which leaves room for the vendor app at the price of a connect of
several seconds on the next command.

Three cross-cutting concerns live here rather than in the entities:

* **Availability + a periodic probe.** Bringing the proxy link up is the
  availability signal; no GET is involved. While unavailable, or while a
  permanent link is missing, a probe retries on a timer and on every matching
  0x1828 advert, behind a backoff that widens after each failed GATT connect.
  Misses flip availability only once ``UNREACHABLE_THRESHOLD`` of them pile up.
* **A repairs issue.** When the proxy stays unreachable past a threshold, a
  user-facing ``proxy_unreachable`` repair is raised with actionable advice
  (the single-slot problem: close the Häfele app / free the lamp). It clears on
  the first successful connect.
* **SEQ persistence (replay safety).** The mesh silently drops any network PDU
  whose SEQ it has already seen, so the sequence cursor must survive restarts.
  It is kept in-memory as ``self._seq`` (seeded once from the Store plus a
  safety margin at start) and mirrored back to the Store after every command.
  Crucially the margin is added **once**, not per command, so the cursor does
  not inflate on every call.

# the lock was free, each one four GATT connects. Forty minutes and 61 failed
# connects later (BlueSight: `kind: storm`) the node still refused everyone, the

# preceded, spent its four on a node that had been unplugged, and habluetooth
# charged all four to the proxy that heard it best. Two paths are not gated on
# purpose: the drop watchdog, because a drop follows a success, which cleared
# the wait (if its reconnect fails, the wait is back); and a command from the
