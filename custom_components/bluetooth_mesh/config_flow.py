"""Config flow for the Bluetooth Mesh integration.

The user imports a mesh network provisioned by the ThingOS / Häfele Connect
Mesh app, which exports it as a ``.connect`` JSON file. Rather than a native
file-upload widget (unreliable across the various HA front ends), the flow
takes the *contents* of that file pasted into a multiline text field, parses
it with :func:`btmesh.network_model.Network.from_connect`, and — on success —
stores the raw JSON verbatim in the config entry. The runtime (a later task)
re-parses it at setup time, so no key bytes need to be serialised here.
