"""MeshController: a clean async facade over MeshNode + BearerPump + GattBearer.

This is the surface the Home Assistant integration drives. It hides the sync
producer / async bearer plumbing (:class:`btmesh.pump.BearerPump`) and the
raw access-message codecs behind a handful of high-level, best-effort coroutines
(``set_onoff``, ``get_onoff``, ``set_lightness``, ``set_ctl_temperature``).

Best-effort means a control command returns ``None`` on timeout rather than
raising, so the integration can mark an entity unavailable without special-casing
exceptions. The :class:`btmesh.network_model.Network` supplies the keys and IV
index; addressing is by element unicast, taken from that same static model.
