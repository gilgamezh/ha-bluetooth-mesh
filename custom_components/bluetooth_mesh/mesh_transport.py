"""HA-native bridge from Home Assistant's bluetooth stack to a mesh GattBearer.

The ``btmesh`` library is transport-agnostic: :class:`btmesh.bearer.GattBearer`
wraps any connected bleak-compatible GATT client and speaks the Mesh Proxy
protocol. In ``phase0`` the standalone :class:`btmesh.bearer.EsphomeTransport`
brings up bleak-esphome itself to scan for and connect to a proxy node. Inside
Home Assistant that machinery already exists — the ``bluetooth`` integration
runs the ESPHome proxies and maintains the discovery snapshot — so this module
is the thin HA-side equivalent: find the mesh proxy advertising our Network ID,
connect to it through HA's bluetooth APIs, and hand the connected client to an
unchanged ``GattBearer``.

All mesh logic (0x1828 parsing, SAR framing) stays in ``btmesh``; this module
only bridges HA-bluetooth to ``GattBearer`` and therefore imports HA at module
scope (it only ever runs inside Home Assistant).

    a local Bluetooth adapter has none until habluetooth 5 (HA 2025.9). Read

    it, keeping those HA can currently connect through (their per-advert
    ``connectable`` flag is set), in snapshot order.

    Why scan the full snapshot rather than the ``connectable=True`` view: HA keeps
    the connectable-only history and the full history as separate structures that

    contradicting it. Actual connectability is re-verified at connect time by

    A match nobody has heard for more than ``max_age`` seconds is skipped rather
