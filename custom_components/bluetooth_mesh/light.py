"""Light platform for the Bluetooth Mesh integration (Task B4).

Every lighting OUTPUT of a provisioned node becomes a :class:`MeshLight`: one
per element carrying its own Light Lightness server (0x1300), so a two-channel
controller is two lights, and a node that dims nothing falls back to its
Generic OnOff servers (0x1000). A node with a single output, which is every
lamp, yields exactly one entity, addressed across the whole node. Each mesh
group of the export is one :class:`MeshGroupLight` on top of its members. Each
command is addressed to the element that actually hosts the model it targets,
because an element silently ignores an opcode it has no model for. The
entity's capabilities scale with the output's composition:

* Light CTL server (0x1303) present → tunable white: HA ``COLOR_TEMP`` mode
  (which in HA implies brightness too).
* else Light Lightness server (0x1300) → dimmable: HA ``BRIGHTNESS`` mode.
* else Generic OnOff only → HA ``ONOFF`` mode.

All BLE lives behind the coordinator (``entry.runtime_data``); the entity only
enumerates the static network model and calls the coordinator's best-effort
command coroutines. State is what the lamp says: it is read back when the mesh
becomes reachable, and a Set shows the request only until the node answers,
then settles on the Status it reported, or goes back to the previous value when
it reported nothing. A group is the exception, because a group Set is
unacknowledged by design: it reflects the request on its members.
The coordinator's availability governs whether HA shows the entity as live or
stale.
