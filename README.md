Control **Bluetooth Mesh lighting** from Home Assistant — Häfele Connect Mesh
(Loox), other ThingOS luminaires, and standard SIG-Mesh lights — using the
Bluetooth you already have. No vendor gateway, no extra box.

These are the lights that came with an app and nothing else. Home Assistant has
no Bluetooth Mesh support of its own, so until now the choices were a vendor
gateway (Häfele's has been discontinued) or an experimental BlueZ setup that
will not run on Home Assistant OS. This removes both.

## Will this work for me?

**Your lights.** Bluetooth Mesh luminaires: Häfele Connect Mesh and Loox,
ThingOS-based lights sold under other names, and standard SIG-Mesh nodes. If
the lamp was set up from a phone app over Bluetooth and there is no hub in the
box, it is likely one of these.

**What you need.** An ESPHome Bluetooth proxy within range of the lights, or a
Bluetooth adapter on the Home Assistant machine — whichever you already have.
Nothing else to buy.

**Colour is not supported yet.** On/off, brightness and warm-to-cool white all
work. Full-colour RGB lamps do not: the author's own lights are tunable-white,
and rather than ship colour untested, it is left out. If you have colour
hardware and want to help, that is exactly what is missing.

**You can keep using the vendor app.** The integration joins your existing mesh
rather than replacing it, so the app and Home Assistant coexist — see
[Coexistence with the vendor app](#coexistence-with-the-vendor-app-shared-keys).

**What Home Assistant shows is what the lamp says.** Brightness and colour
temperature are read back from the light itself, not assumed from the last
command — so changing a lamp from the app is reflected here.

## What it controls

Each lighting output becomes one Home Assistant `light` entity, with
capabilities read from its mesh composition:

| Node model | HA capability |
| --- | --- |
| Generic OnOff (`0x1000`) | on / off |
| Light Lightness (`0x1300`) | + brightness |
| Light CTL (`0x1303` / `0x1306`) | + colour temperature (tunable white) |

A lamp is one output, so it is one entity. A **multi-channel controller** is
one mesh node whose channels are its elements, each carrying its own dimmer,
and each of those becomes its own entity, named after the output as the vendor
app names it, all grouped under the one device. A lamp that merely spreads its
models over several elements stays one entity.

**Not yet supported:** RGB / full-colour lamps (Light HSL / xyL). The author's
hardware is tunable-white only, so colour is left unimplemented rather than
shipped untested — contributions with colour hardware to validate against are
welcome.

### State is read, not assumed

A Bluetooth Mesh proxy starts every connection forwarding *nothing* inbound
until the client configures its address filter — which is why early versions
never saw a single reply and could only display what they had last commanded.
The integration configures that filter, so:

* on/off and brightness are **read from the lamp** when the mesh becomes
  reachable, and again after every reconnection — including changes you made
  from the vendor app while Home Assistant was away;
* a light whose state has not been read yet reports `unknown` rather than
  guessing `off` — an invented state is one another integration can act on and
  make true;
* colour temperature is read back too, and the lamp is asked once for the
  Kelvin range it actually tracks — so the slider offers that lamp's real
  extremes instead of a conventional 2700–6500 guess;
* a command shows at once, then settles on what the lamp **answered**. A lamp
  that answers nothing leaves the entity as it was, and the log says so once
  per such episode — a node that keeps answering reads while dropping writes
  is otherwise invisible from the dashboard, which would keep asserting the
  state it asked for.

Some lamps map colour temperature the wrong way round: they glow warm white when
Home Assistant says cool. Tick those under **Lamps with inverted colour
temperature** (Settings → Devices & Services → *Bluetooth Mesh* → **Configure**)
and their requested temperature is mirrored before being sent. Leave the others
alone — mirroring a lamp that is already correct inverts warm and cool end to
end. It is a per-lamp setting rather than a per-manufacturer one because the
quirk varies between models and firmware of the same brand.

The mirror applies when a command is sent, so a change takes effect from the
next one: ticking or unticking the box does not re-colour a lamp that is already
lit. It reflects around the range the lamp reports, so a lamp whose limits are
not the conventional 2700–6500 is mirrored around its own midpoint rather than
an assumed one.

Adding a node, or refreshing a key, is a **Reconfigure** on the existing entry:
paste the new export and keep every entity id and its history. If something is
not working, **Download diagnostics** on the integration reports the Network ID
it looks for, every mesh proxy Home Assistant currently sees, the IV Index and
sequence cursor in use, the unicast address commands are sent from, which
application key they are encrypted with next to the ones each model is bound
to, and each node's composition — with no key material in it, so it is safe to
paste into an issue. That last group matters because a mismatch there is
invisible on air: a node discards a message it cannot authenticate without
answering, so the integration transmits perfectly and the lamp does nothing.

The dump also **probes each node under its device key** (a `Config Relay Get`,
whose request and reply both fit in one unsegmented message). Its `answered`
field is the honest reachability signal — it needs no application key, no model
binding and no vendor support, so it separates *the message never arrived* from
*the node received it and did nothing*, which is the single hardest thing to
tell apart on a mesh. The `relay` block beside it says whether that node
forwards anything from the proxy connection into the rest of the network.

## Two deliverables

This repository ships two things, mirroring the `pymadoka-ng` / `daikin_madoka`
split:

1. **`btmesh`** (`src/btmesh/`) — a Home-Assistant-independent Python library
   implementing the mesh stack: crypto (k1–k4 derivations, AES-CMAC, AES-CCM,
   network obfuscation), network/transport/access layers, proxy-PDU
   segmentation/reassembly, a provisioner, and a GATT bearer that runs over
   `bleak` / `habluetooth` (so it works through ESPHome Bluetooth proxies).
2. **`bluetooth_mesh`** (`custom_components/bluetooth_mesh/`) — a HACS custom
   integration: config flow, storage, a connection coordinator, and Home
   Assistant entities (starting with `light`).

## How it works

```
Home Assistant (pure-Python mesh stack: btmesh)
  │  bleak / habluetooth
  ▼
ESPHome BLE proxy (existing fleet)          ← or any local BT adapter
  │  GATT: Mesh Proxy Service (proxy protocol tunnel)
  ▼
A mesh node with GATT Proxy enabled (any powered lamp)
  │  advertising bearer (mesh relay)
  ▼
The rest of the mesh network
```

One GATT connection serves the whole network: the stack maintains a single
tunnel to one proxy node, and the mesh relays messages to every other node.

**When the nodes cannot hear each other** (say, two boxes either side of a
wall), one tunnel reaches only part of the network. The option *Connect through
every reachable proxy node* then holds a tunnel to each node it can, at most
four (the first plus the three strongest others), and sends every message
through all of them. That has two costs:

- each tunnel takes the node's only proxy slot, so the vendor app cannot
  connect to any node while Home Assistant holds them;
- each tunnel also takes a connection slot on the ESPHome Bluetooth proxy that
  carries it. ESPHome offers three by default (`bluetooth_proxy:
  connection_slots`), shared with every other Bluetooth device that connects
  through that proxy, so plan for one slot per linked node.

Leave it off unless some lamps never respond while others do.
No BlueZ meshd, no dedicated ESP32 firmware — it works on Home Assistant OS in
a VM with no local radio.

## Coexistence with the vendor app (shared keys)

Rather than replicating a vendor's proprietary activation step, this project
**rides on the mesh network the vendor app already created**. The app exports
its network as a `.connect` JSON (ThingOS format) containing the NetKey, the
AppKey, and each node's unicast address. The integration imports that file,
connects its proxy to the same network, and sends **standard**, app-keyed mesh
messages (Generic OnOff Set, Light Lightness Set, …) to each node's unicast
address.

Because both sides share the same keys, the vendor app and Home Assistant can
control the **same lamps** — HA drives the same lights the app provisioned.

A mesh node has a **single** GATT-proxy connection slot, so Home Assistant and
the app cannot both hold it at once. The integration keeps its proxy connection
open by default (so commands are instant), which means the vendor app cannot
connect while HA is loaded. If you still want to use the app, set a **keep-alive
timeout** (Settings → Devices & Services → *Bluetooth Mesh* → **Configure**):
after that many idle seconds HA releases the lamp so the app can take over, at
the cost of a few-second reconnect on HA's next command. `0` = always
connected.

## Installation

**From HACS (recommended).** This button opens the repository in your own Home
Assistant. HACS asks whether to add it as a custom repository: accept, then
download **Bluetooth Mesh** and restart Home Assistant. Then
carry on from step 2 below.

[![Open the Bluetooth Mesh repository inside your Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=dasimon135&repository=ha-bluetooth-mesh&category=integration)

If the button does not reach your instance, step 1 adds it by hand:

1. **Add the repository to HACS** as a custom repository
   (HACS → Integrations → ⋯ → Custom repositories), category **Integration**,
   then install *Bluetooth Mesh* and restart Home Assistant.
2. **Export your network** from the vendor app as a `.connect` file.
3. **Add the integration** (Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration →
   *Bluetooth Mesh*) and paste the contents of the `.connect` file when
   prompted. Keep this file private — it contains your mesh network keys and
   should never be committed to a repository.
4. *(Optional)* **Configure** the keep-alive timeout if you want to keep using
   the vendor app — see [Coexistence](#coexistence-with-the-vendor-app-shared-keys).

A Bluetooth transport is required: an ESPHome Bluetooth proxy on your network,
or a local Bluetooth adapter usable by Home Assistant. At least one mesh lamp
must be powered and in range of that proxy for Home Assistant to reach the
network.

## Development

```bash
# Library only (fast; no Home Assistant):
uv sync
uv run pytest                  # btmesh library + phase0 harness suites

# Full suite (library + HA integration) in a HA-equipped environment:
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
pytest                         # everything: library, phase0, tests/ha

# Lint (CI pins this exact version):
pip install ruff==0.16.0
ruff check .
```

Run `pytest` with no path argument: `testpaths` in `pyproject.toml` covers the
library tests, `tests/ha/`, and the `phase0/` harness suite. Running a single
file from `tests/ha/` is not a shortcut — `test_init.py` and `test_diagnostics.py`
import `custom_components` and reach for the Bluetooth manager lazily, inside the
test bodies, and rely on an earlier file in the session having done so at module
scope. On their own they fail with `ModuleNotFoundError` or `RuntimeError:
BluetoothManager has not been set`, which looks like a broken checkout. Re-run
the whole suite before believing a single file's red. The `tests/ha/`
tree is guarded with `pytest.importorskip`, so it stays skipped when Home
Assistant is not installed and runs for real when it is. CI installs Home
Assistant and runs the combined suite on Linux; see
`.github/workflows/tests.yml` (ruff + pytest) and
`.github/workflows/validate.yml` (hassfest + HACS).

> On Windows, `tests/ha/conftest.py` neutralises `pytest-socket` because the
> event loop's self-pipe needs a socket there. A test that reaches the network
> — one that triggers a real config-entry reload, say — will therefore pass
> locally and fail on Linux CI. That is CI doing its job, not a flake.

### Releasing

`docs/release-flow.md` describes how a change reaches a published release:
branch, PR, both CI workflows, a hardware-validated release candidate, then the
tag. It also carries the rules that came out of getting it wrong — re-reading
the remote before tagging, and keeping `Closes #N` out of merge bodies when the
issue is waiting on a reporter's confirmation.

### Vendored library

`src/btmesh/` is the canonical library (the source of truth, published to PyPI).
Because HACS installs `custom_components/bluetooth_mesh/` as-is, the integration
ships a **vendored copy** of the library at
`custom_components/bluetooth_mesh/btmesh/`, so it installs with no external
`btmesh` dependency (only `cryptography`, which Home Assistant already provides).
After changing anything under `src/btmesh/`, re-sync the vendored copy:

```bash
python scripts/sync_vendored_btmesh.py
```

CI runs `python scripts/sync_vendored_btmesh.py --check` and fails on drift.
It has to: each tree is imported by a different half of the test suite, so a
forgotten re-sync breaks no test and would ship a stale stack to HACS users on
a green build.

## Credit and honesty

This project grew out of reverse-engineering a Häfele Connect Mesh setup after
its vendor gateway was discontinued. The mesh crypto and codec layers are
implemented from the public Bluetooth SIG Mesh specification and validated
against the specification's official sample vectors; the coexistence approach
was discovered empirically against real hardware. It is an independent,
unofficial project and is not affiliated with or endorsed by Häfele, ThingOS,
or the Bluetooth SIG.

## Support

Open an issue here for anything about this integration — a bug, a question, or a
feature request. Forum threads are for general discussion and user-to-user help;
nothing raised there is tracked, and it can be lost. An issue cannot.

Before you open one, read [Credit and honesty](#credit-and-honesty): this is a
reverse-engineered stack, and it says plainly what is validated against the
specification and what was found empirically against real hardware.

To get a useful answer on the first exchange, include:

- your Home Assistant version and the version of this integration;
- the nodes involved — brand, model, and whether they were ever provisioned by a
  vendor app — and the ESPHome proxies used, with board and ESPHome version;
- the diagnostics download (Settings → Devices & services → Bluetooth Mesh →
  **⋮** → *Download diagnostics*);
- a debug log, plus what you did, what you expected, and what happened instead.

### Staying informed

New versions are announced here first. A short note may follow in the forum
thread, but this page is the only complete record. To hear about one:

- **HACS already offers you the update**, release notes included — nothing to do;
- subscribe to `https://github.com/dasimon135/ha-bluetooth-mesh/releases.atom` in
  any RSS reader, or inside Home Assistant through the `feedreader` integration;
- or use **Watch → Custom → Releases** on this repository.
