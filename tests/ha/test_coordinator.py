"""Tests for the mesh runtime coordinator (Task B3, on-demand model).

The coordinator now connects to the proxy *per command*, runs, and disconnects
again — freeing the lamp's single proxy slot after every command. Here the two
BLE seams are mocked — ``find_proxy_address`` and ``async_connect_bearer`` from
:mod:`.mesh_transport` — and a ``FakeController`` is injected in place of the
real :class:`btmesh.controller.MeshController`, so no radios are touched. Run in
the daikin_madoka venv (HA + HHCC)::
